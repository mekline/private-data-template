# private-data-template

I keep having cases where I need to conduct analyses on datasets which cannot be shared publicly at a given time, but for which I want to establish an archive for analyses and potential later sharing.  So, here's a template so I don't keep having to redo the same stuff. 

Features: 

- data and analysis folders with readme files to make sure folders propagate
- .gitignore file that ignores the whole data folder except for that readme
- .gitignore also has some content to play nice with Macs and R scripting
- that's about it
